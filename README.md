### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Exploration of Happiness
+ This project is conducted by [Feng Su]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] In this specific project, I mainly applied statistical analysis, texting mining techniques and NLP to drive insights form the this happy moment database. For example, What can make people feel happy? Are there any difference between different kind of people? Can we use specific words to predict features of individuals? 
The answers for the above three questions are "Yes"! In addition, I further investigate the correlation between different words and drive some really interesting insigts on a spcific word.
